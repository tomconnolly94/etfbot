This project is designed to handle investments in individual stocks, everytime it runs it will evaluate the money available based on the stock owned and residual account funds and rebalance the investments according to the chosen investment strategy.

Investment strategies will be limited to a single static weighting method initially but as the project goes on more strategies will be offered.
